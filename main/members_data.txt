1	Ashkan Hayati	ashkan-hayati	PhD Student	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	ashkan.hayati@unisa.edu.au	NULL	Ashkan Hayati is an AI strategy consultant, researcher, and full-stack developer with over 20 years of experience in IT, software engineering, and academic research. He recently completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of South Australia, where he investigated enhancing remote collaboration in virtual reality (VR) using inter-brain synchrony measured through EEG hyperscanning. His work explored how immersive environments, social presence, and cognitive alignment can improve teamwork and performance in both real-world and digital settings.\n\nAshkan?s research sits at the intersection of AI, AR/VR, and neuroscience, combining virtual environments with advanced analytics to study collaboration. He has designed VR experiments for shared search tasks, developed pipelines for EEG-based synchrony analysis, and published interdisciplinary research in HCI, workplace psychology, and immersive technologies.\n\nAlongside academia, Ashkan has delivered industry-focused AI solutions in multi-agent systems, generative AI, and intelligent call centres, consulting for organisations such as the Centre for Workplace Excellence, Like Services Group, and Rima Soft. His expertise spans responsible AI, governance frameworks, and applied automation, ensuring AI systems are robust, explainable, and aligned with human values.\n\nPassionate about building human-centred AI and immersive technologies, Ashkan bridges research and industry to create tools that enhance collaboration, wellbeing, and organisational performance.	assets/images/team/1757906812.png	adelaide	PhD Student	faculty	2	active	https://www.linkedin.com/in/afhayati/	ashkan.hayati@unisa.edu.au	NULL	https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_jPnCcoAAAAJ	- Immersive collaboration and VR/AR\n- EEG hyperscanning & neuroscience	- PhD, Computer Science\n- Master of Information Technology\n- Bachelor of Industrial Engineering	Completed a PhD in Computer Science at UniSA, advancing research on EEG hyperscanning and inter-brain synchrony to enhance collaboration in VR environments.\n\nDesigned and led immersive VR experiments that combined neuroscience, social presence, and task similarity to study teamwork and cognitive alignment.\n\nDeveloped AI-driven EEG analysis pipelines for real-time measurement of brain connectivity and synchrony during collaborative tasks.\n\nPublished and presented interdisciplinary research across neuroscience, AR/VR, workplace psychology, and human?computer interaction (HCI).\n\nBuilt AI-powered VR simulations and collaborative prototypes for investigating organisational behaviour, leadership training, and remote teamwork.\n\nDesigned multi-agent AI systems integrating conversational agents, generative AI, and RAG pipelines for workplace analytics and support.\n\nContributed to workplace wellbeing and psychosocial safety climate research by applying AI for automated feedback analysis, sentiment detection, and risk assessment.\n\nRecognised for bridging AI, AR/VR, and neuroscience to deliver human-centred solutions that advance both academic research and real-world applications.	0	2025-09-04 11:18:11	2025-09-15 04:13:02
2	Mark Billinghurst	mark-billinghurst	Director	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	mark.billinghurst@unisa.edu.au	NULL	Prof. Mark Billinghurst has a wealth of knowledge and expertise in human-computer interface technology, particularly in the area of Augmented Reality (the overlay of three-dimensional images on the real world).\n\nIn 2002, the former HIT Lab US Research Associate completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering, at the University of Washington, under the supervision of Professor Thomas Furness III and Professor Linda Shapiro. As part of the research for his thesis titled Shared Space: Exploration in Collaborative Augmented Reality, Dr Billinghurst invented the Magic Book ? an animated children?s book that comes to life when viewed through the lightweight head-mounted display (HMD).\n\nNot surprisingly, Dr Billinghurst has achieved several accolades in recent years for his contribution to Human Interface Technology research. He was awarded a Discover Magazine Award in 2001, for Entertainment for creating the Magic Book technology. He was selected as one of eight leading New Zealand innovators and entrepreneurs to be showcased at the Carter Holt Harvey New Zealand Innovation Pavilion at the America?s Cup Village from November 2002 until March 2003. In 2004 he was nominated for a prestigious World Technology Network (WTN) World Technology Award in the education category and in 2005 he was appointed to the New Zealand Government?s Growth and Innovation Advisory Board.\n\nOriginally educated in New Zealand, Dr Billinghurst is a two-time graduate of Waikato University where he completed a BCMS (Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Science)(first class honours) in 1990 and a Master of Philosophy (Applied Mathematics & Physics) in 1992.\n\nResearch interests: Dr. Billinghurst?s research focuses primarily on advanced 3D user interfaces such as:\n\n    Wearable Computing ? Spatial and collaborative interfaces for small wearable computers. These interfaces address the idea of what is possible when you merge ubiquitous computing and communications on the body.\n    Shared Space ? An interface that demonstrates how augmented reality, the overlaying of virtual objects on the real world, can radically enhance face-face and remote collaboration.\n    Multimodal Input ? Combining natural language and artificial intelligence techniques to allow human-computer interaction with an intuitive mix of voice, gesture, speech, gaze and body motion.	assets/images/team/1757027179.png	director	Lab Member	faculty	1	active	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL	1	2025-09-04 11:33:54	2025-09-04 23:06:19
